            <h5><span class="toggle-icon">+</span> What is IVF?</h5>
            <div class="toggle-content">
               <p>In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) is an advanced assisted reproductive technology (ART) used to help
                  individuals and couples conceive a child. The process involves retrieving eggs from a woman's
                  ovaries, fertilizing them with sperm in a laboratory, and then transferring the resulting embryos
                  into the woman's uterus. IVF bypasses certain infertility issues and enhances the chances of a
                  successful pregnancy.</p>

            <div class="toggle-content">
               <p>IVF is recommended for various fertility challenges, including:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li><strong>Tubal Factor Infertility:</strong> Blocked or damaged fallopian tubes that prevent the
                     egg and sperm from meeting.</li>
                  <li><strong>Male Factor Infertility:</strong> Low sperm count, poor sperm motility, or abnormal
                     sperm morphology.</li>
                  <li><strong>Unexplained Infertility:</strong> No identifiable cause despite thorough evaluation.
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Endometriosis:</strong> Severe cases that interfere with ovulation, fertilization, or
                     implantation.</li>
                  <li><strong>Ovulation Disorders:</strong> Conditions like Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) and
                     other hormonal disorders affecting ovulation.</li>
                  <li><strong>Premature Ovarian Failure:</strong> Early menopause or significantly reduced ovarian
                     function.</li>
                  <li><strong>Genetic Disorders:</strong> Risk of passing on hereditary conditions, managed with
                     Preimplantation Genetic Testing (PGT).</li>
                  <li><strong>Previous Fertility Treatment Failures:</strong> Unsuccessful outcomes from fertility
                     medications, intrauterine insemination (IUI), or surgery.</li>
                  <li><strong>Age-Related Infertility:</strong> Advanced maternal age affecting egg quantity and
                     quality.</li>
                  <li><strong>Cancer Patients:</strong> Fertility preservation before undergoing treatments like
                     chemotherapy or radiation.</li>
                  <li><strong>Recurrent Pregnancy Loss:</strong> Multiple miscarriages that may benefit from genetic
                     testing of embryos.</li>
